# üå± Week 2 Explorer Update ‚Äì @alwynvanwyk

**Track:** Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures  
**Week:** 2 of 6  
**Date:** 31 August 2025  

---

## ‚úÖ Progress
- Workspace and research journal set up.
- Guiding research questions defined and pinned.
- **Forum archaeology completed** across multiple ecosystems:
  - Gitcoin Governance Forum (6 insights extracted)
  - Optimism Governance Forum (2 insights extracted)
  - KlimaDAO Forum (2 insights extracted)
  - Safe Global Forum (2 insights extracted)
  - PushDAO Forum (1 insight extracted)
  - Hypercerts documentation (1 insight extracted)
- **Extraction Log updated** with 14 total allocator pain point quotes and insights.
- **Pain point clusters identified** across 6 major categories:
  - Systemic Allocation Biases (tech, hype, social capital, popularity biases)
  - Eligibility & Inclusion Challenges (VC bias, brand fragmentation, insider tensions)
  - Signal Quality & Evaluation Gaps (oracle problems, definition ambiguity, credibility issues)
  - Process & Operational Inefficiencies (manual toil, ad hoc permissioning, role transparency)
  - Accountability & Engagement Issues (conflicts of interest, activity tracking, reputation tracking)
  - Evaluation Process Fragmentation (duplication confusion, expertise limitations, visibility gaps)
- **Survey instruments designed**:
  - Comprehensive 20-question survey for detailed research
  - Simplified 3-question survey for broader distribution

## üöß Blockers
- No live allocator interviews scheduled yet (parallel track being seeded).
- Need to distribute surveys to gather primary research data.

---

## üî≠ Next Steps
- **Distribute surveys** to allocator community for primary research data collection.
- **Draft allocator personas** from extracted quotes and survey responses.
- **Finalize outreach list** of 5‚Äì7 potential interviewees and begin sending invites.
- **Begin synthesis** of forum insights into preliminary Insight Map framework.

## üéØ Reflection
**Key patterns emerging from Week 2 research:**

The analysis revealed **6 distinct cluster categories** of allocator pain points, representing a more nuanced understanding than initially anticipated. The most significant finding is the prevalence of **systemic allocation biases** - not just individual preferences, but structural issues where technical expertise, social capital, and marketing prowess consistently overshadow actual impact measurement.

**Signal quality and evaluation gaps** emerged as a critical bottleneck, with allocators struggling with oracle problems for non-digital impact, definitional ambiguity between impact and profit, and credibility issues around future funding commitments.

**Process inefficiencies** create compounding problems - manual contributor management, ad hoc permissioning, and lack of role transparency not only waste time but actively undermine accountability and progressive decentralization efforts.
