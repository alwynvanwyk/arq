# 🌱 Week 2 Explorer Update – @alwynvanwyk

**Track:** Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures  
**Week:** 2 of 6  
**Date:** 31 August 2025  

---

## ✅ Progress
- Workspace and research journal set up.  
- Guiding research questions defined and pinned.  
- Began forum archaeology (Gitcoin Governance Forum).  
- Extracted 5–6 allocator pain point quotes into Extraction Log.  
- Logged early themes (e.g., [placeholder: add themes here]).  

---

## 🚧 Blockers
- Still refining categories for signals vs. pain points.  
- No live allocator interviews scheduled yet (parallel track being seeded).  

---

## 🔭 Next Steps
- Expand forum archaeology to **Optimism governance forums**.  
- Draft allocator personas from extracted quotes.  
- Finalize outreach list of 5–7 potential interviewees and begin sending invites.

## 🗂️ Artifact
- **Extraction Log**: [Insert link here]  
- (Optional) Quick visual cluster of allocator pain points.

## 🎯 Reflection
Early signals suggest allocators are struggling with [placeholder: e.g., “signal overload” and “lack of local context”].  
Capturing these friction points is helping shape the **Insight Map** for Week 2.
