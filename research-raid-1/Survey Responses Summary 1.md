### **Summary of Allocator Reflections (4 responses)**

1. **Roles & Ecosystems**
   Respondents spanned founders, DAO stewards, and community fund managers. They primarily allocate in Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gitcoin, Celo, Base, Polygon, and Greenpill ecosystems. Allocation sizes ranged from under \$1K to \$250K, with experience levels from under a year to 5+ years.

2. **Signals Trusted Most**
   Commonly relied-on signals included **team reputation and track record**, **on-chain metrics**, **community endorsements**, and **technical documentation quality**. Some also valued **peer allocator recommendations** and **third-party audits**.

3. **Biggest Challenges**
   Recurring pain points included:

* Distinguishing between **hype vs. substance**.
* Lack of **standardized evaluation criteria**.
* Information gaps making confident decisions difficult.
* Too many applications to review thoroughly.
* Assessing **real-world impact** and outcomes.

4. **Evaluation Gaps**
   Allocators find it hardest to evaluate:

* Early-stage or pre-product projects.
* Technical infrastructure projects.
* Community/social impact projects with intangible outcomes.

5. **Confidence Builders**
   Respondents highlighted the need for:

* **Better impact measurement tools**.
* **Standardized project data**.
* **More peer allocator discussions** and cross-validation.
* **Clearer signals** on impact and credibility.

6. **Perceptions of Fairness**
   All agreed that current processes **unfairly favor certain projects**—especially those with strong social media presence, technical/infrastructure focus, or existing reputation and popularity. Smaller or emerging projects were seen as disadvantaged.

7. **Desired Improvements**
   Key improvements suggested were:

* Stronger focus on **outcomes and impact**.
* Avoiding trend-chasing and staying consistent.
* Better **interoperability and treasury management** across mechanisms.

---

✨ **Core insight:** Allocators consistently feel overwhelmed by information noise, frustrated by inconsistent evaluation standards, and worried that current processes amplify **hype, social capital, and reputation** rather than genuine impact.
