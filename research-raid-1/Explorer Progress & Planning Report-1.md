**Track:** Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures
**Date:** Week 1

## âœ… Activities So Far

* **Application Accepted** â†’ Confirmed as Explorer in Track 1.
* **Kickoff Preparation**:
  * Attended kickoff session.
  * Reviewed project scope, deliverables, and research tracks.
  * Designed initial research roadmap.
* **System Setup TODO**:
  * Create Extraction Template for logging allocator pain points
    and signals.
  * Draft first entry from Gitcoin Forum as an example.

## ðŸ“… Plan for the Next 5 Weeks

### **Week 1 â€“ Setup & First Insights**

* Set up workspace and research journal.
* Update Charmverse Explorer camp.
* Define guiding research questions.
* Begin forum archaeology (Gitcoin Governance Forum).
* Extract 5â€“6 allocator pain point quotes.
* Draft skeleton for Week 1 update post.

### **Week 2 â€“ Expand Source Mining + Interview Setup**

* Extend forum archaeology to **Optimism governance forums** (RetroPGF
  reflections).
* Log additional allocator pain points (5â€“6 more).
* Identify potential interview candidates (DAO allocators, Gitcoin
  stewards).
* Send first outreach messages to schedule 2â€“3 interviews for Weeks
  3â€“4.

### **Week 3 â€“ First Interviews & Synthesis**

* Conduct 1â€“2 short interviews (20â€“30 min each).
* Extract allocator insights into the template.
* Begin clustering insights into allocator personas.
* Draft early **Insight Map**.

### **Week 4 â€“ Signal Architecture Framework**

* Complete forum mining across 2â€“3 ecosystems (Gitcoin, Optimism,
  Arbitrum).
* Refine Insight Map with combined sources (forums + interviews).
* Draft **Signal Architecture Framework** (visual + explanatory
  notes).
* Identify early signal gaps.

### **Week 5 â€“ Gap Memo & Consolidation**

* Write **Signal Gap Memo** (1â€“2 pages).
* Refine Signal Architecture Framework based on team feedback.
* Package Week 5 update: Insight Map + Framework + Gap Memo draft.

### **Week 6 â€“ Final Deliverables**

* Polish all outputs:
  * Insight Map
  * Signal Architecture Framework
  * Signal Gap Memo
* Frame findings through **TVF Impact lens**.
* Deliver final artifact + closing call participation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Outputs to Deliver

* **Weekly updates** (progress, blockers, next steps, artifacts).
* **Insight Map** (allocator personas, pain points, decision
  journeys).
* **Signal Architecture Framework** (how signals flow, where trust
  breaks).
* **Signal Gap Memo** (missing/undervalued signals).
* **Final Artifact** (packaged research outputs + TVF framing).

## Summary

My research is off to a good start: system setup identified, initial
insights logged, and a clear 5-week roadmap in place.
Iâ€™ll have to run a parallel effort to line up real interviews to deepen findings and
to complement forum-based research.
