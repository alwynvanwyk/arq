# Survey Summary – Anonymized (v0)

Scope: Aggregated, privacy-preserving summary from the Google Form. Raw responses are kept private and are not committed to this repo.

## Overview
- Sample size: 4 responses (small-N; directional only)
- Audience: DAO stewards, community fund managers, badgeholders/operators (generalized)
- Ecosystems (generalized): Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gitcoin, Celo, Base, Polygon
- Allocation sizes (generalized): < $1k up to $250k

## Top themes (preliminary counts)
- Distinguishing hype vs substance: [N]
- Lack of standardized evaluation criteria: [N]
- Difficulty assessing real-world impact/outcomes: [N]
- Information overload / limited time for due diligence: [N]
- Technical complexity beyond evaluator expertise: [N]

## Signals trusted most (patterns)
- Team track record / reputation
- On-chain usage/metrics
- Technical documentation quality; audits/code quality
- Community endorsements and peer allocator input

## Hardest project types to evaluate (patterns)
- Early-stage / pre-product
- Technical infrastructure
- Community/social impact with intangible outcomes

## What would increase confidence (patterns)
- Better impact measurement tools and clearer success metrics
- Standardized project data/evaluation schema
- More peer allocator discussion/cross-validation
- Credible reputation/attestation layer

## Perceptions of fairness
- Processes seen to advantage: strong social media presence, technically-oriented or well-established teams, popularity signals
- Concern for visibility gaps among smaller/emerging projects

## Sanitized exemplar quotes (roles generalized)
- “As a [role], I often struggle to separate signal from hype when submissions are inconsistent.”
- “A more mature reputation/attestation layer would help me trust claims faster.”
- “Standardized success metrics would reduce the ‘vibe check’ and make reviews more comparable.”
