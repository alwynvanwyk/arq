# Outreach Script – 20–30 min Interview (Anonymized)

Hi [Name],

I’m doing Week 3 interviews for a research sprint on allocator decision-making (how we separate hype from substance, evaluate impact, and handle info overload). You filled out the short survey (thank you!) and indicated you’re open to a brief follow-up.

Could we do a 20–30 min chat this week?
- Topics: signals you trust/distrust, one recent hard decision, what would increase confidence
- Privacy: anonymized notes only; no PII in any public repo
- Format: casual call

If helpful, here are a few time options (your TZ):
- [Day, Date, 10:00–10:30]
- [Day, Date, 14:00–14:30]
- [Day, Date, 17:00–17:30]

Or choose any time that works: [Calendly/Link]

If you’d prefer to share thoughts async, I can also send 3–4 prompts.

Thanks again — really appreciate your perspective.

— Alwyn
