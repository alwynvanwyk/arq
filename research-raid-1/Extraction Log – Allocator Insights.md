- Use the table to capture **allocator quotes and observations** from forums, reports, podcasts, or interviews.  
- Each row = one ‚Äúinsight unit‚Äù (allocator statement + your tag).  
- Over time, clusters will emerge (e.g., ‚Äúsignal overload,‚Äù ‚Äúlack of local context,‚Äù ‚Äúmissing grassroots signals‚Äù).
