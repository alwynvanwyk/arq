Perfect — let’s merge your **Week 1 Deliverables** with the **Parallel Track** into a single, time-boxed plan. With 4 hours total, the goal is to (1) get your research system live, (2) capture a *minimum viable set* of insights, and (3) set up the interviews pipeline.

Here’s a **combined 4-hour execution plan** for Week 1:

---

## ⏳ Week 1 Focus (4 Hours Total)

### **Hour 1 – Setup & Orientation**

* Create workspace folder + starter docs (*Extraction Log* + *Research Journal*).
* Define and pin **3 guiding research questions**: allocator pain points, trusted/ignored signals, unlocking TVF.
* Update **Charmverse Explorer Camp** with profile + basic plan of action.

---

### **Hour 2 – Forum Archaeology Kickoff**

* Go to **Gitcoin Governance Forum**.
* Choose **1 RetroPGF reflection thread**.
* Extract **2–3 allocator quotes** into the Extraction Log using the template.
* Add quick tags/insights for each (e.g., “signal overload,” “lack of local context”).

---

### **Hour 3 – Deepen Forum Insights**

* Scan a **second Gitcoin thread** (grant feedback or allocator reflections).
* Extract **2–3 more allocator quotes** into the log.
* Summarize early **themes** in your Research Journal (e.g., trusted signals vs. missing signals).

---

### **Hour 4 – Parallel Track: Seeding Interviews + Update Skeleton**

* Draft a **list of 5–7 potential interviewees** (ENS, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gitcoin badgeholders, Greenpill stewards).
* Prepare **outreach draft message** (short + low-barrier).
* Draft skeleton of your **Week 1 update post**:

  * **Progress:** workspace set up, guiding questions defined, 5–6 allocator quotes extracted.
  * **Blockers:** still mapping categories, no interviews scheduled yet.
  * **Next Steps:** Optimism forum + outreach to interviewees in Week 2.
  * **Artifact:** link to Extraction Log.

---

✨ **By end of Week 1 (4 hours):**

* Workspace + journal set up.
* Guiding questions clarified.
* Charmverse updated.
* 5–6 allocator insights extracted + tagged.
* Early themes noted.
* Interview pipeline seeded (names + draft outreach ready).
* Skeleton update post drafted.

Would you like me to also **draft the Week 1 update post skeleton in Markdown** right now, so you can just fill in details as you go?
