# 🌿 Week 3 Explorer Update – @alwynvanwyk

**Track:** Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures
**Week:** 3 of 6
**Date:** 14 September 2025

---

## ✅ Progress
- Survey live (Google Forms); responses: 4 (raw data kept private).
  - See “Anonymized Survey Summary” below for public aggregates only.
- Interviews: 2 respondents consented; being scheduled for this week (20–30 mins each).
- Extraction Log: forum insights baseline complete; interview entries will be added as de-identified rows (e.g., “Interview #1 — DAO steward”).
- Personas v0: outline ready; to be drafted after first 2 interviews.
- Mutual aid session (Funding Readiness Quest): contributed ideas to support two fellow researchers (Trinity and Kent) and invited a few close collaborators to broaden perspectives while keeping the group intentionally small and focused; modeled a playful yet practical approach to rotating mutual aid aligned with ARQ goals.
- Peer evaluations: assessed nine peer submissions (excluding my own), scoring the value of their insights for the research.

## 🚧 Blockers
- Scheduling constraints for interviews (availability + time zones).
- Small-N survey sample so far (promotion ongoing).
- Privacy constraints (raw responses cannot be stored in this public repo).

---

## 🔭 Next Steps (Week 3 focus)
1) Conduct 1–2 interviews; capture anonymized notes; extract 4–6 insight units into the Extraction Log.
2) Update Anonymized Survey Summary with theme counts and sanitized exemplar quotes.
3) Draft Personas v0 (2–3 personas) grounded in clusters and interview data.
4) Draft Insight Map v0 (repo one-pager) and reference Miro board.
5) Prepare Week 3 claim (post link + artifacts list).

## 📊 Anonymized Survey Summary (public aggregates only)
Scope: 4 responses (private dataset). No PII stored here; raw responses remain off-repo.

Top themes (counts) — preliminary:
- Distinguishing hype vs substance: [N]
- Lack of standardized evaluation criteria: [N]
- Difficulty assessing real-world impact: [N]
- Limited time for due diligence: [N]

Sanitized exemplar quotes (roles generalized):
- “As a [role], I struggle with … because …”
- “We lack visibility into … which makes … hard.”

Notes: Update counts and exemplars after additional responses; keep strict anonymization.

## 🧭 Interview Plan & Schedule
| Interview # | Role (generic) | Status | Date/Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [DAO steward / Badgeholder / Operator] | Scheduled | [Date, TZ] | Focus on signals trusted vs missing |
| 2 | [DAO steward / Badgeholder / Operator] | Scheduled | [Date, TZ] | Walk through a difficult allocation |

Interview prompts (mapped to clusters):
- Role & scope; recent hard allocation decision walkthrough.
- Signals trusted vs distrusted; missing signals that would increase confidence.
- Bias and fairness concerns; mitigation strategies.
- Operational frictions (permissioning, roles, tooling) and accountability gaps.
- Evaluation fragmentation: duplication, expertise limits, visibility gaps.

---

## 🧩 Personas v0 (placeholder)
Use interview and survey data to draft 2–3 personas across the six cluster dimensions.
- Persona A — [e.g., “Process-Constrained Steward”]: goals, pains, signals trusted/missing, evaluation heuristics.
- Persona B — [e.g., “Impact-Seeking Badgeholder”]: goals, pains, signals trusted/missing, evaluation heuristics.
- Persona C — [optional]

---

## 🗺️ Insight Map v0 (placeholder)
- Layers: Systemic biases; Signal quality & evaluation gaps; Operational frictions; Accountability; Fragmentation.
- Signal flows: present vs missing signals; trust sources vs contested sources.
- Link to Miro for visual clustering and evolving structure.

## 🔒 Privacy Statement
To protect respondent privacy, raw survey responses and detailed interview notes are kept off-repo.
Only anonymized aggregates and sanitized quotes are published here.

## 📝 Changelog
- v0.1 (W3): Scaffold created; placeholders for interview outcomes and anonymized survey summary.
