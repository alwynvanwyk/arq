# 🌿 Week 3 Explorer Update – @alwynvanwyk

**Track:** Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures
**Week:** 3 of 6
**Date:** 14 September 2025

---

## ✅ Progress
- Survey live (Google Forms); responses: 4 (raw data kept private).
  - See “Anonymized Survey Summary” below for public aggregates only.
- Interviews: 2 respondents consented; being scheduled for this week (20–30 mins each).
- Extraction Log: forum insights baseline complete; interview entries will be added as de-identified rows (e.g., “Interview #1 — DAO steward”).
- Personas v0: outline ready; to be drafted after first 2 interviews.
- Mutual aid session (Funding Readiness Quest): As part of my Week 3 activities, I participated in a gamified mutual aid session hosted on the Funding Readiness Quest platform, where I contributed ideas to support two fellow researchers, Trinity and Kent. I also evaluated nine peer submissions—excluding my own—by scoring the value of their insights for the research. Together, these activities modeled a playful yet practical approach to rotating mutual aid, aligning with the ARQ program’s broader goal of experimenting with new ways of distributing support and feedback among peers. Awesome initiative, ForkInWisdom!

## 🚧 Blockers
- Scheduling constraints for interviews (availability + time zones).
- Small-N survey sample so far (promotion ongoing).
- Privacy constraints (raw responses cannot be stored in this public repo).

---

## 🔭 Next Steps (Week 3 focus)
1) Conduct 1–2 interviews; capture anonymized notes; extract 4–6 insight units into the Extraction Log.
2) Update Anonymized Survey Summary with theme counts and sanitized exemplar quotes.
3) Draft Personas v0 (2–3 personas) grounded in clusters and interview data.
4) Draft Insight Map v0 (repo one-pager).
5) Prepare Week 3 claim (post link + artifacts list).

## 📊 Anonymized Survey Summary (public aggregates only)
Scope: 4 responses (private dataset). No PII stored here; raw responses remain off-repo.

Top themes (counts) — preliminary:
- Distinguishing hype vs substance: [N]
- Lack of standardized evaluation criteria: [N]
- Difficulty assessing real-world impact: [N]
- Limited time for due diligence: [N]

Sanitized exemplar quotes (roles generalized):
- “As a [role], I struggle with … because …”
- “We lack visibility into … which makes … hard.”

Notes: Update counts and exemplars after additional responses; keep strict anonymization.

## 🧭 Interview Plan & Schedule
| Interview # | Role (generic) | Status | Date/Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [DAO steward / Badgeholder / Operator] | Scheduled | [Date, TZ] | Focus on signals trusted vs missing |
| 2 | [DAO steward / Badgeholder / Operator] | Scheduled | [Date, TZ] | Walk through a difficult allocation |

Interview prompts (mapped to clusters):
- Role & scope; recent hard allocation decision walkthrough.
- Signals trusted vs distrusted; missing signals that would increase confidence.
- Bias and fairness concerns; mitigation strategies.
- Operational frictions (permissioning, roles, tooling) and accountability gaps.
- Evaluation fragmentation: duplication, expertise limits, visibility gaps.

## 🔒 Privacy Statement
To protect respondent privacy, raw survey responses and detailed interview notes are kept off-repo.
Only anonymized aggregates and sanitized quotes are published here.

## 📝 Changelog
- v0.1 (W3): Scaffold created; placeholders for interview outcomes and anonymized survey summary.
