# Interview Guide – Allocators (Week 3)

Purpose: 20–30 minutes to deepen Week 3 synthesis. Anonymized; no PII captured. Tailored to survey themes: hype vs substance, standardization, impact assessment, info overload, peer validation, reputation/attestation.

---

## 0) Opening & Consent (1–2 mins)
- Quick intro and purpose of study
- Privacy: anonymized notes; no PII in public repo; you can skip any question
- Time check (20–30 mins) and OK to record transcription?

## 1) Role & Context (2–3 mins)
- What kinds of allocation decisions do you make? Typical size and cadence?
- Which ecosystems are most relevant to you right now?

## 2) Recent Decision Walkthrough (5–7 mins)
- Tell me about a recent allocation decision you found hard.
  - What made it difficult? Signals you looked for? Which were missing?
  - Where did you find conflicting signals? How did you resolve them?
  - What would’ve made you confident faster?

## 3) Signals & Trust (5–6 mins)
- Which signals do you trust most, and why? (e.g., team track record, on-chain metrics, peer recs, audits, community endorsements, docs)
- Which signals do you discount or find noisy? Why? (e.g., social media presence, popularity)
- If you had a “magic dashboard,” what signals/fields would it show to help you decide?
- How valuable would a richer reputation/attestation layer be for you? In what format?

## 4) Frictions & Gaps (6–7 mins)
- Biggest frictions from your perspective now: (pick top 2–3)
  - Distinguishing hype vs substance
  - Lack of standardized evaluation criteria / inconsistent data
  - Assessing real-world impact & outcomes
  - Information overload; limited time for due diligence
  - Technical complexity beyond your expertise
- For each: where exactly does it show up in your workflow, and what’s the minimal fix that would help?

## 5) Fairness & Bias (3–4 mins)
- Do current processes unfairly favor certain project types? How does that show up?
- What, if anything, do you do to counteract those biases?

## 6) Operations & Accountability (2–3 mins)
- Any operational pain (permissions, roles, contributor tracking) that slows evaluation or follow-up?
- What accountability or reputation signals do you wish were visible post-allocation?

## 7) Quick Futures (2–3 mins)
- If you could change one thing about current allocation mechanisms, what would it be?
- Would you be open to reviewing an early “Insight Map” or “Persona” summary later for feedback?
