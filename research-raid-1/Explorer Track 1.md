Explorer for Track 1: Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures
Prompt: How do different types of allocators (DAO stewards, ReFi leads, NGOs, L2 teams) experience friction in making capital allocation decisions. And what kinds of signals help them trust where to send funds?
Why it matters: This track supports the “broad listening” challenge. Understanding allocator perception is key to designing mechanisms that move real capital.
Sub-questions you might explore:
What makes a coordination effort legible to funders? How do allocators differ in their readiness to act on signals? What patterns emerge in ecosystem “cold spots” where good work goes unfunded?
