Cookie Jar Research Raid
Duration: 6 weeks 
Start: August 6 · End: September 20
Weekly Reward: 0.08 ETH

Explorers are frontline researchers. They deep-dive into a specific research prompt across one of three tracks, working to surface usable insights, prototypes, and new signals for Ethereum-aligned capital allocators.
- Explore frictions points!
- Map insights!
- Prototype!
- Discover new primitives!

Responsibilities
- Pursue a track prompt (choose one of the 3) and define your specific angle of inquiry.
- Join the Kickoff Call on August 6.
- Post a weekly update in the Explorers Circle thread (progress, blockers, learnings).
- Share links to your weekly thread replies on cookiejar.wtf to claim your payout.
- Activate Meta-Items (Research Aid and Party) as needed
- Collaborate with Alchemists to refine your research and distill insights.
- Deliver your final Artifact, Insight Map, and TVF Reflection by the end of the Raid.
- Join the closing call.

Meta-Items You’ll Use
- Research Aid | Request clarification, feedback, or wizard support by tagging @Alchemists in your thread |
- Party | Propose a co-work session to jam or align; share back in Explorers Circle |

Research Tracks
- Track 1: Allocator Pain Mapping & Signal Architectures
- Track 2: Growth, Activation & Strategic Readiness
- Track 3: Product & Mechanism R&D (UX, Coordination, Interop)

Possible Artifacts & Outcomes
- Insight Maps | Allocator personas, signal maps, decision journeys
- Reports | Forum archaeology, landscape review, coordination pain taxonomy
- Prototypes | UX flows, dashboards, signaling mockups
- Frameworks | Signal emergence models, readiness indices, tooling typologies
- Memos/Briefs | “Why X ecosystem stalled”, “Signal gap analysis”
