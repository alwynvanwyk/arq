# Personas v0 (Scaffold based on Survey Responses Summary 1.md + to be refined with Week 3 interviews)

This scaffold captures 2-3 early allocator personas derived from the 4-response survey summary.
The intention is to replace placeholders with evidence from the coming weeks' anonymized interview notes.

---

## Persona A: Process-Constrained Steward
- Role archetype: DAO steward / council member
- Ecosystems: Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gitcoin (generic)
- Allocation range & cadence: $10k-50k; seasonal or rolling
- Goals: Allocate fairly and efficiently to impactful work; avoid trend-chasing
- Trusted signals: Team track record, on-chain metrics, third-party audits, technical docs, peer recs
- Distrusted/noisy: Social media presence, popularity contests
- Missing signals: Standardized project data; clearer outcome metrics; reputation/attestations layer
- Pain highlights (clusters):
  - Signal Quality & Evaluation Gaps: hype vs substance; unclear success metrics
  - Process & Operational Inefficiencies: info overload; limited time for due diligence
  - Evaluation Fragmentation: expertise limits; inconsistent submissions
- Decision heuristics: Prioritize outcomes evidence and credible references over visibility; require minimal standardized fields
- Fairness lens: Wary of advantages for well-funded or highly visible teams; seeks counter-bias checks
- Improvements desired: Better impact measurement tools; standardized evaluation framework; peer review moments
- Representative sanitized quote (placeholder): "As a steward, I need a faster way to separate substance from hype without reading 50 tabs."

## Persona B: Impact-Seeking Badgeholder
- Role archetype: Badgeholder / community evaluator
- Ecosystems: Optimism, Gitcoin, Base (generic)
- Allocation range & cadence: <$10k individual votes; round-based
- Goals: Reward provable public goods impact; surface overlooked contributors
- Trusted signals: Community endorsements with context, on-chain usage, user testimonials, ecosystem alignment
- Distrusted/noisy: Brand clout without substance; fragmented brand submissions
- Missing signals: Clearer impact definitions (impact vs profit); outcome tracking snapshots; peer discussion threads
- Pain highlights (clusters):
  - Systemic Allocation Biases: social capital & popularity effects
  - Signal Quality & Evaluation Gaps: definition ambiguity; credibility issues
  - Accountability & Engagement: reputation/activity tracking post-funding
- Decision heuristics: Combine quantitative usage with qualitative peer attestations; look for consistency over time
- Fairness lens: Concerned that current mechanics amplify visibility over impact; favors mechanisms that lower noise
- Improvements desired: Standardized success metrics; light-weight pairwise/peer review prompts; curated attestations
- Representative sanitized quote (placeholder): "Popularity signals are loud; the impact signals I need are quiet."

## Persona C: Infrastructure - 1st Operator (optional)
- Role archetype: Round operator / infra fund manager
- Ecosystems: Multi-chain (Polygon, Celo) and L2s
- Allocation range & cadence: $50k-250k+ grants; quarterly
- Goals: Support critical infra while staying open to early-stage builders
- Trusted signals: Technical documentation quality, audits/code quality, team history
- Distrusted/noisy: Hype around novel mechanisms without reliability proof
- Missing signals: Cross-ecosystem interoperability metrics; treasury/runway clarity; maintainership data
- Pain highlights (clusters):
  - Evaluation Fragmentation: cross-ecosystem comparability; visibility gaps
  - Process & Operational Inefficiencies: manual review overhead; inconsistent submissions
  - Eligibility & Inclusion: rules clarity for VC-backed/brand-linked projects
- Decision heuristics: Prefer reliability track records; phased funding with milestones
- Fairness lens: Seeks to counterbalance popularity with necessity/criticality assessments
- Improvements desired: Interoperable schemas; repository of standardized signals; milestone-based attestations
- Representative sanitized quote (placeholder): "I need comparable data across ecosystems without a research rabbit hole."
